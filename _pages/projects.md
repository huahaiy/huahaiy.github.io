I have worked on so many projects over the years. This page lists some recent active
projects.

Juji Platform
---

I drive R&D of Juji Platform, an AI conversational agent platform that is the
basis of Juji Studio, Juji IDE and Juji API products of [Juji
Inc.](https://juji.io).

Juji is the leading conversational agent platform that allows customers to
retain total control while using generative AI, a unique yet critical capability
that enables successful enterprise use of generative AI.

I have given talk talks and written about Juji platform.

Datalevin

This is an open-source database that I have been working on. It is a new
generation of general purpose database that is much more ergonomic than
traditional SQL RDBMS, while still has the benefits of relational databases
(unlike those NoSQL DBs). Datalevin uses a user friendly favor of Datalog as the
query language and is good at deductive reasoning and analytics. My
goal is not just to compete with existing databases, but also to lay the
foundation for advanced artificial intelligence of the future: Just like memory
is the center of human cognition, databases ought to serve the same purpose in
artificial intelligence.

I have written some articles about Datalevin.

* [Achieving High Throughput and Low Latency through Adaptive Asynchronous
  Transaction](https://yyhh.org/blog/2025/02/achieving-high-throughput-and-low-latency-through-adaptive-asynchronous-transaction/)
* [Competing for the JOB with a
  Triplestore](https://yyhh.org/blog/2024/09/competing-for-the-job-with-a-triplestore/)

[![Clojars Downloads](https://img.shields.io/clojars/dt/juji%2Feditscript)](https://clojars.org/juji/editscript)

This is an open-source Clojure library I wrote to diff/patch data structures. It
is widely in the Clojure community. I have given a talk on its use: [Data Diffing Based Software
Architecture Patterns](https://youtu.be/n-avEZHEHg8?si=_okX3Qexb5JtlYOf)

The work on the library is mostly done, but I am still maintaining it.
