I have worked on so many projects over the years. This page lists some recent active
projects.

Juji Platform
---

I drive R&D of Juji Platform, an AI agent platform that is the basis of Juji
Studio, Juji IDE and Juji API products of [Juji Inc.](https://juji.io).

It is the leading agent platform that allows users to retain total control while using
generative AI, a critical capability that enables enterprise use of generative
AI.

I have written some high level overviews.
