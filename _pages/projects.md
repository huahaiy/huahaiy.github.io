I have worked on so many projects over the years. This page lists some recent active
projects.

Juji Platform
---

I drive R&D of Juji Platform, an AI conversational agent platform that is the
basis of Juji Studio, Juji IDE and Juji API products of [Juji
Inc.](https://juji.io).

Juji is the leading conversational agent platform that allows customers to
retain total control while using generative AI, a unique yet critical capability
that enables successful enterprise use of generative AI.

I have written some high level overviews.

Datalevin

This is an open-source database that I have been working on since 2020. It is a
new generation of general purpose database that is much more ergonomic than
traditional SQL RDBMS, while still has the benefits of relational databases
(unlike those NoSQL DBs). Read [this
article](https://yyhh.org/blog/2024/09/competing-for-the-job-with-a-triplestore/)
for details.

Datalevin uses Datalog as the query language and is good at deductive reasoning
and analytical data processing. My goal is not just to compete with existing
databases, but also to lay the foundation for advanced artificial intelligence
of the future.

I plan to continue this work indefinitely. [github](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin)

[![Clojars Downloads](https://img.shields.io/clojars/dt/juji%2Feditscript)](https://clojars.org/juji/editscript)

This is an open-source Clojure library I wrote to diff/patch data structures. It
is widely used to support data diff based software architecture in the Clojure
community.

The work on the library is mostly done, but I am still maintaining it.
